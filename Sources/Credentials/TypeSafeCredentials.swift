// MARK TypeSafeCredentials

/**
 A `TypeSafeMiddleware` for authenticating users. This protocol is implemented by plugins that identify the user using information supplied by the `RouterRequest`. The plugin must implement a static `authenticate` function which returns an instance of `Self` on success. This instance defines the name of the authentication provider (e.g. "HTTPBasic"), and an `id` that uniquely identifies a user for that provider.
 ### Usage Example: ###
 ```swift
 public final class TypeSafeHTTPBasic : TypeSafeCredentials {
 
     public let id: String
     public let provider: String = "HTTPBasic"
     private static let users = ["John" : "123"]
 
     public static func authenticate(request: RouterRequest, response: RouterResponse, onSuccess: @escaping (TypeSafeHTTPBasic) -> Void, onFailure: @escaping (HTTPStatusCode?, [String : String]?) -> Void, onSkip: @escaping (HTTPStatusCode?, [String : String]?) -> Void {
 
         if let user = request.urlURL.user, let password = request.urlURL.password {
             if users[user] == password {
                 return onSuccess(UserHTTPBasic(id: user))
             } else {
                 return onFailure()
             }
         } else {
             return onSkip()
         }
     }
 }
 ```
